These are some suggestions on whats left to do for a really good grade :)))))))))))))))))))

For Tableau, you’ll want visuals that clearly communicate the cost comparisons, trends, and forecasts. A good set would be:
Time-Series Line Graphs:
1. Median Rent over time by county.
2. Median Home Value over time by county.
3. Median Property Taxes over time by county.

Cost Comparison:
1. Bar chart comparing rent vs. buy (owner cost with/without mortgage + taxes) per county.
2. Break-even timeline: how many months/years renting vs. buying pays off.

Wealth Projection:
1. Cumulative wealth or savings projection if renting vs. buying, by county.

Heatmaps:
1. Counties colored by high/low rent, home value, or property tax.
2. Tables (optional for detail):
3. Yearly table of median rent, home value, taxes, and owner costs per county for reference.

You can layer filters by year, county, or housing type to make dashboards interactive.

Here’s a clean layout for your Tableau dashboard:
1. Dashboard Title: Forecasting Housing Outcomes with $250k
Top Row – Filters:
Year (slider or dropdown: 2015–2024)
County (multi-select)
Housing Scenario (Rent vs Buy)

Left Column – Time-Series Graphs:
Median Rent Over Time (line chart by county)
Median Home Value Over Time (line chart by county)
Median Property Tax Over Time (line chart by county)


Right Column – Cost & Break-even:
Rent vs Buy Comparison (stacked bar chart: Rent vs Owner Costs with/without mortgage)
Break-even Timeline (line or gantt-style chart showing years until buying becomes cheaper than renting)
Bottom – Heatmap / Summary Table:

County Heatmap: color-coded by total cost (rent or buy).

Data Table: yearly median rent, home value, taxes, owner costs for selected counties.

Optional Enhancements:
Tooltips with cumulative costs and NPV/IRR projections.
Highlighting the county with the fastest break-even point.
This setup keeps the dashboard interactive, intuitive, and focused on comparing rent vs. buy outcomes.
If you want, I can also suggest the exact chart types and fields to drag for each visualization in Tableau.
