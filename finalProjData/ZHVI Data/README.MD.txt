Site Details: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
A measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. Available as a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure and as a raw measure.
Zillow publishes top-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region) and bottom-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region).

Zillow also publishes ZHVI for all single-family residences ($, typical value for all single-family homes in a given region), for condo/coops ($), for all homes with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ bedrooms ($).

Note: Starting with the January 2023 data release, and for all subsequent releases, the full ZHVI time series has been upgraded to harness the power of the neural Zestimate.

More information about what ZHVI is and how it’s calculated is available on this overview page. Here’s a handy ZHVI User Guide for information about properly citing and making calculations with this metric.
